# Wanderlust: An Airbnb-inspired MERN Stack Project

Welcome to our Wanderlust project! This MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, and partially React.js) stack repository is inspired by Airbnb, featuring authentication, authorization, map integration, and following an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.

## Features

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Secure authentication methods enable users to register, login, and access features based on their roles. Passport.js is used for authentication, and cookies are utilized for session management.
- **Map Integration**: Enhanced user experience with integrated maps, likely used for property listings or location-based searches.
- **MVC Architecture**: Organized project structure adhering to the Model-View-Controller pattern for maintainability.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js, facilitating robust API creation.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **[Not Fully] React.js**: Though not fully utilized, React.js is a library for building user interfaces.
- **Passport.js**: Middleware for authentication in Node.js applications.
- **Cookies**: Used for session management.
